# Overview #
Great Realities
	1. Ints are not Integers, Floats are not Reals
		Example 1: Is x^2 > 0?
		Floats yes!
	Integers 40 000 * 40 000 =  1600000000
	Integers 50 000 * 50 000 = -1794967296
	2. You got to know Assembly
	3. Memory Matters Random Access Memory
		a. Memory must be allocated and managed.
		b. Many applications are memory dominated.
		c. Cache and virtual memory can effect greatly on the programs performance.
		d. Adapting a program to the memory system can lead to major speed improvments.
	4. There is more performance than...
		a. Understand how programs are copmiled and executed.
		b. How to measure a program performance and identify bottlenecks.
		c. How to improve without destryoing code modularity and generality.

	5. Computers do more than execute..
		a. They need to get data in and out.
		b. They communicate with each other over networks.
